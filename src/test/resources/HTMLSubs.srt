23
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:11,896
One, the attacker must enter
the squid shape court,

24
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,566
run past the defense, and then tap
the area inside the squid's head

25

with his foot to secure the win.

26
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,738
Two, the defender must block
the attacker's advance

27
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:23,783
and force them outside
of the court's bounds in order to win.

28
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,160
Three, if a situation arises,

29
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:29,747
in which either player is unable
to continue playing the game,

30
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,958
the last one standing will be the winner.

31
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,217
A player's unable to continue.

32
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:44,554
